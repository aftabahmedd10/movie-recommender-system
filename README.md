# Movie Recommendation System

## Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a movie recommendation system that suggests the top 5 movies based on a user's selected movie. This system utilizes various movie features to identify similar films, enhancing user experience and engagement.

## Description
This project leverages a dataset containing extensive details about movies, including attributes like genre, cast, crew, and ratings. The recommendation system is designed to analyze a selected movie and provide personalized suggestions based on user preferences.

### Key Features
- **Dataset Attributes**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier for each movie.
  - `original_title`: Title of the movie as released.
  - `genres`: Genres associated with the movie.
  - `cast`: List of actors involved in the film.
  - `crew`: Key production staff (e.g., director, producer).
  - `vote_average`: Average rating given by viewers.
  - `overview`: Brief synopsis of the movie plot.

- **Recommendation Logic**:
  - **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggests movies similar to the selected one based on features like genre, cast, and plot.
  - **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends movies based on user interaction patterns and preferences.


## Tools Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Analysis Libraries**: 
  - **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: 
  - **Scikit-learn**: For implementing recommendation algorithms.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data exploration and visualization.

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and irrelevant features.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Analyze and select relevant features for recommendations (e.g., genres, cast).
3. **Recommendation Algorithms**:
   - Implement content-based filtering to find similar movies.
  
## Expected Outcomes
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Provide users with a tailored list of movies based on their selected choice.
- **Enhanced User Engagement**: Increase user satisfaction through relevant movie suggestions.
